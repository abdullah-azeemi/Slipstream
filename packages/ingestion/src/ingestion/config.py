"""
Configuration for the ingestion service.

Shared values (database, Kafka, telemetry/R2 artifacts) come from
``slipstream_config.CommonSettings``; this module adds only the ingestion
service's own settings.

pydantic-settings reads these values from environment variables automatically.
On your laptop they come from .env — in production from real environment
variables. The variable names match exactly what's in .env.example.
