Feature engineering for race prediction.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ARCHITECTURE NOTE — read this before changing anything
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The single most important rule in feature engineering: NO DATA LEAKAGE.

Data leakage means your model accidentally sees information from the future
during training. It produces models that look great in cross-validation but
fail completely in production — because in production, the future doesn't exist.

How we prevent it:
  1. We load ALL race history once, sorted by date.
  2. For each race we're computing features for, we filter history to
     rows with date STRICTLY BEFORE the current race's date.
  3. Rolling features (team form, driver history) are computed from
     that filtered slice only.

This is called a "point-in-time" feature computation. An analyst sitting
in the paddock on qualifying day would only have access to past races —
never future ones. Our features must respect the same constraint.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FEATURE PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A useful feature answers: "Would a knowledgeable human use this to make
a better prediction?" If yes, it's probably worth including.

Our features fall into three categories:

1. QUALIFYING PERFORMANCE — what happened on Saturday
   grid_position, quali_gap_ms, sector gaps/ranks, compound used

2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT — what's been happening over the season
   team_form_3race, driver_circuit_avg, quali_to_race_conversion

3. CIRCUIT CONTEXT — what kind of track is this
   is_street_circuit, is_power_circuit, is_high_df_circuit

    Compute rolling team performance before a specific date.

    WHY window=3:
    F1 car development cycles are roughly 3-4 races. A team solving an
    aero problem will show improvement over ~3 races. Shorter windows
    are too noisy (one DNF destroys the signal). Longer windows miss
    recent changes (e.g. a car upgrade at race 10 is diluted by bad
    results from races 1-9).

    This is a hyperparameter we could tune — in production you'd test
    window=2, 3, 4, 5 and pick the one that minimises CV MAE.

    WHY we use TEAM results not DRIVER results:
    A driver's individual result has too much noise (crashes, strategy,
    luck). The team's aggregate over 2 drivers better represents the
    underlying car performance, which is what we want to capture.
