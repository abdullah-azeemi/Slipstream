Driver profile API.

GET /api/v1/drivers/<code>/profile

Career totals and recent results come from ``historical_results`` (Jolpica),
identity from the newest ``drivers`` row, and style features/archetype from
``driver_features`` / ``driver_embeddings``. Every block is optional so a
driver missing from one source still returns a usable profile.
