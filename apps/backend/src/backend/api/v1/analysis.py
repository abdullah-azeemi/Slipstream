        FastF1 official corner position-based detection.

        WHY this beats DBSCAN/sliding-window:
        Both previous approaches tried to INFER where corners are from speed data.
        That\'s fragile — different drivers take different lines, brake at different
        points, and carry different speeds. Inference always has false positives.

        FastF1 provides OFFICIAL corner positions (X, Y coordinates) from the
        FIA circuit map. These are ground truth — the corners are exactly where
        the circuit designers put them, not where the speed trace happens to dip.

        Algorithm:
        1. Fetch official corner X/Y positions from FastF1 (cached, ~0ms)
        2. For each official corner, find telemetry samples within a spatial
           radius (80m in track coordinates)
        3. Apex = minimum speed sample within that window
        4. Run braking/throttle analysis from that apex

        Result: exactly N corners (Melbourne=14), correctly numbered T1-T14,
        identical corner set for every driver, zero false positives.

        Fallback: if FastF1 data unavailable, falls back to P35 percentile
        + brake-evidence filter (the previous approach).
